    Options - Miscellaneous:
        -l LEVEL, --loglevel LEVEL   The level of log to produce, as an
                                     integer or a level name. [default: INFO]

        -W WARNINGCTL                Change warning behaviour (same as the
                                     Python `-W` flag). [default: default]

    Template:
        The default filename of the pictures and videos on Instagram doesn't
        show anything about the file you just downloaded. But using the -T
        argument allows you to give instalooter a filename template, using the
        the following format with brackets-enclosed ({}) variable names among:
        - ``id``*² and ``code``*² of the instagram id of the media
        - ``ownerid``*, ``username`` and ``fullname`` of the owner
        - ``datetime``*: the date and time of the post (YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss)
        - ``date``*: the date of the post (YYYY-MM-DD)
        - ``width``* and ``height``*
        - ``likescount``* and ``commentscount``*

        ²: use at least one of these to make sure the generated file name
        is unique (``datetime`` is not unique anymore since multiple posts).

        *: use these only to quicken download, since fetching the others may
        take a tad longer (in particular in hashtag download mode).

        You are however to make sure that the generated filename is unique,
        so you should use at least id, code or datetime somewhere.
        Examples of acceptable values:
            - {username}.{datetime}.{code}
            - {username}-{likescount}-{width}x{height}.{id}

    Time:
        The --time parameter can be given either a combination of start and stop
        date in ISO format (e.g. 2016-12-21:2016-12-18, 2015-03-07:, :2016-08-02)
        or a special value among: "thisday", "thisweek", "thismonth", "thisyear".

        Edges are included in the time frame, so if using the following value:
        `--time 2016-05-10:2016-04-03`, then all medias will be downloaded
        including the ones posted the 10th of May 2016 and the 3rd of April 2016.
