Usage
=====

.. toctree::

instaLooter provides a command line interface, that you can call with

   In some cases, the ``instaLooter`` command is not added into
   the ``$PATH`` after installation. It is possible to perform
   all the following actions nevertheless by replacing occurences
   of ``instaLooter`` with ``python -m instaLooter`` (or
   ``python3 -m instaLooter``).

   $ instaLooter hashtag <hashtag> <directory> [options]

Download pictures/videos from a single post:

.. _Template:

Template
--------

The default filename of the pictures and videos on Instagram doesn't show
anything about the file you just downloaded. But using the ``-T`` argument
allows you to give instaLooter a filename template, using the following
format with brackets-enclosed (``{}``) variable names among:

- ``id``\*\² and ``code``\² of the instagram id of the media
- ``ownerid``\*, ``username`` and ``fullname`` of the owner
- ``datetime``\*: the date and time of the post (YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss)
- ``date``\*: the date of the post (YYYY-MM-DD)
- ``width``\* and ``height``\*
- ``likescount``\* and ``commentscount``\*

:\*:
   use these only to quicken download, since fetching the others may take
   a tad longer (in particular in hashtag download mode).

:\²:
   use at least one of these in your filename to make sure the generated
   filename is unique.

Examples of acceptable values:

.. code-block:: console

    $ instaLooter <profile> -T {username}.{datetime}
    $ instaLooter <profile> -T {username}-{likescount}-{width}x{height}.{id}
    $ instaLooter <profile> -T {username}.{code}.something_constant


.. _Time:

Time
----

The ``--time`` parameter can be given either a combination of start and stop
date in ISO format (e.g. ``2016-12-21:2016-12-18``, ``2015-03-07:``,
``:2016-08-02``) or a special value among: *thisday*, *thisweek*, *thismonth*,
*thisyear*.

Edges are included in the time frame, so if using the following value:
``--time 2016-05-10:2016-04-03``, then all medias will be downloaded
including the ones posted the 10th of May 2016 and the 3rd of April 2016.

.. _Credentials:

Credentials
-----------

The ``--username`` and ``--password`` parameters can be used to log to
Instagram. This allows you to download pictures/videos from private profiles
you are following. You can either provide your password directly
or type it in later for privacy purposes.

.. code-block:: console

   $ instaLooter ... --username USERNAME --password PASSWORD
   $ instaLooter ... --username USERNAME
   Password: # type PASSWORD privately here
